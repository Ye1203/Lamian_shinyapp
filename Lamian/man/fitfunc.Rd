\usage{
fitfunc(
  iter,
  diffType = "overall",
  gene = rownames(expr),
  test.type = "Time",
  testvar = testvar,
  EMmaxiter = 100,
  EMitercutoff = 0.05,
  ncores = 1,
  expr = expr,
  cellanno = cellanno,
  pseudotime = pseudotime,
  design = design,
  verbose.output = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{a numeric number indicating which iteration it is in a permutation test. If iter = 1, it is  fitting the original data (not permuted).}

\item{diffType}{one of overall, meanDiff, or trendDiff.}

\item{gene}{a vector of gene names. It is used when users want to externally specify the genes (or specify the order or genes).}

\item{test.type}{the type of test. One of c('Time', 'Variable). Case insensitive.}

\item{testvar}{a numeric number indicating the column in the design matrix that needs to be tested while controlling for other columns (not intercept). Default is 2. testvar = 2 means the second column in the design needs to be tested.}

\item{EMmaxiter}{an integer indicating the number of iterations in the EM algorithm.}

\item{EMitercutoff}{a numeric number indicating the log-likelihood cutoff applied to stop the EM algorithm}

\item{ncores}{the number of cores to be used. If ncores > 1, it will be implemented in parallel mode.}

\item{expr}{gene by cell expression matrix. The expression values should have been library-size-normalized and log-transformed. They can either be imputed or non-imputed.}

\item{cellanno}{a dataframe where the first column are cell names and second column are sample names.}

\item{pseudotime}{a numeric vector of pseudotime, and the names of this vector are the corresponding cell names.}

\item{verbose.output}{logical. If TRUE, print intermediate information.}

\item{design:}{a matrix. Number of rows should be the same as the number of unique samples. Rownames are sample names. First column is the intercept (all 1), second column is the covariate realization valuels for each of the samples.}
}
\value{
a list of two elements. The first is for full model, while the second is for null model. Each element is a list containing data and parameter estimates.
}
