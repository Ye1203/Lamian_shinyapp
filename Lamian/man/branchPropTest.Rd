\title{Perform branch proportion test.}
\usage{
branchPropTest(data, design, method = "t.test")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{If "method = 't.test'", then the data is a dataframe or matrix where the each row is a branch, each column is a sample (patient). Values are the branch proportion. This data can be the second element of the output (a list) of evaluate_uncertainty(). If "method == 'multinom'", then the data is a dataframe where each row is a cell, each of the three columns are cell names, branch names, and sample names.}

\item{design:}{a data frame. Number of rows should be the same as the number of unique samples. Each row is a sample. First column is the sample names. Second column is the covariate realization valuels for each of the samples that needs to be tested on.}
}
\value{
a vector of p.values.
}
\description{
This function is used to perform branch proportion test.
}
\examples{
a <- branchPropTest(data = matrix(rnorm(24), nrow =3), design = data.frame(sample = paste0('BM', seq(1,8)), sex = c(rep(1,4), rep(0,4))), method = 't.test')
